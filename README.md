# Crowdfunding_HW1
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. I have organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.
Used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live.

Created a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.
Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 with a dark shade of red, and it should transition to green at 100 and blue at 200.

Created a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.

Created two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.

Data creation, especially using COUNTIFS for the Number columns and those operator formulas like addition and division.

Used line graph to show the relationship between the goal amount and the campaign's success/failure/cancellation is very good. It was clear that I filtered the data perfectly to make an easy-to-understand visualization. Plus, my pivot table really showed your grasp of the data, effectively charting each Kickstarter project's outcome based on specific criteria.
